/*
 * machine dependent operating state
 *
 * An operating state is a cpu execution state that has implications for power
 * management. The DPM will select operating points based largely on the
 * current operating state.
 *
 * DPM_STATES is the number of supported operating states. Valid operating
 * states are from 0 to DPM_STATES-1 but when setting an operating state the
 * kernel should only specify a state from the set of "base states" and should
 * do so by name.  During the context switch the new operating state is simply
 * extracted from current->dpm_state.
 *
 * task states:
 *
 * APIs that reference task states use the range -(DPM_TASK_STATE_LIMIT + 1)
 * through +DPM_TASK_STATE_LIMIT.  This value is added to DPM_TASK_STATE to
 * obtain the downward or upward adjusted task state value. The
 * -(DPM_TASK_STATE_LIMIT + 1) value is interpreted specially, and equates to
 * DPM_NO_STATE.
 *
 * Tasks inherit their task operating states across calls to
 * fork(). DPM_TASK_STATE is the default operating state for all tasks, and is
 * inherited from init.  Tasks can change (or have changed) their tasks states
 * using the DPM_SET_TASK_STATE variant of the sys_dpm() system call.  */
